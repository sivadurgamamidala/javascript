    <div>
        <span><h1 style="color: red;">The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.</h1></span>
        <h3>The "use strict" Directive</h3>
        "use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode". <br><br>
        The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5. <br><br>
        It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript. <br><br>
        The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode". <br><br>
        With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables. <br><br>
        All modern browsers support "use strict" except Internet Explorer 9 and lower <br><br>
        <span><b>NOTE:</b> 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "use strict" is just a string, so IE 9 will not throw an error even if it does not understand it.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </span>
        <h3>Declaring Strict mode</h3>
        Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function. <br><br>
        Declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope (all code in the script will execute in strict mode) <br><br>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p id="demo">Here x is not declared so it shows an error and not displaying the x value</p>
        <p id="demo1">Here y is not declared so it shows an error and not displaying the y value</p>
        <h3>Why Strict Mode?</h3>
        Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript. <br><br>
        Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors. <br><br>
        As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable. <br><br>
        In normal JavaScript, a developer will not receive any error feedback assigning values to non-writable properties. <br><br>
        In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error. <br><br>
